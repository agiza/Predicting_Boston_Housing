# Predicting_Boston_Housing

The goal of the project is to use Boston property value records to create a prediction for a given property's value. The data was gathered from the city of Boston directly via their data.boston.gov website and is the 2018 version. 

The code begins with exploratory data analysis before going into preprocessing the data for machine learning, feature engineering, feature selection, and final model tuning.
